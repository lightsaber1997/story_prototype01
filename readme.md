# MyStoryPal: Interactive English Storybook

## Application Description

**MyStoryPal** is an **Edge AI-based children's English storybook creation application**. It is designed to enable children to learn English naturally and enjoyably through real-time conversations with AI while collaboratively creating English stories.

Unlike cloud-based AI services, this app performs all AI computations on the device's NPU, maximizing the advantages of Edge AI.

**Features of MyStoryPal:**

1. **Conversational Story Co-creation**: When children input sentences or ideas, the AI generates appropriate story sentences in continuation. Through this repetitive process, they can gradually complete a story together.

2. **English Grammar and Vocabulary Feedback**: If there are grammatical errors or typos in the English sentences entered by children, the app corrects them. When children ask about word meanings, it provides friendly explanations. Through this feedback structure, children can naturally improve their English skills.

3. **Creating Personalized Illustrated Storybooks**: Every time four story sentences accumulate, the app generates fairy tale-style images that match the content. This creates a more immersive storybook creation experience.

**Advantages of Edge AI-based Architecture:**

- **Ultra-low Latency Response**: All text and image generation is executed within the device (Copilot+ PC), resulting in fast response times.
- **Complete Offline Operation**: Works without network connection, allowing continuous education even in offline environments.
- **Data Privacy Protection**: Does not transmit children's input text, conversation content, or generated images to external servers, protecting sensitive information.

## How to Use the Application

1. Users input story opening sentences in English through the chat interface.
   - Example: `There was prince` (example sentence with grammatical errors)

2. The AI corrects grammatical errors in the user input and continues with a natural story. It also generates and displays illustration images based on the story content.
   - Text Generation: Phi-3-mini-128k-instruct model
   - Image Generation: Stable-Diffusion-v1.5 model

3. Users check the story content and illustrations generated by AI, then input the next sentence to continue the story.

4. Complete stories can be saved as storybooks.
